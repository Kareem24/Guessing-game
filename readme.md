## Game Logic

The game logic is as follows:

1. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 20.

2. The player enters a guess.

3. The game checks if the player's guess is correct.

4. If the player's guess is correct, the game ends and the player wins.

5. If the payer's guess is incorrect, the player's score reduce by 1 and it give chance for another guess.

6. The game repeat steps until the player either guesses the number correctly or runs out of turns.

## Code explanation

- The code first generate a random number between 1 and 20. then it create a function called `checkInput()` that takes the user's input and displays feedback to the user . The `checkInput()` also decrease the `scoreDigit` variable, which keeps track of the number of guesses the user has made.
  once the `scoreDigit` get to zero the `check` button is disabled.
  The `resetGame()` function actually sets the game back to default
